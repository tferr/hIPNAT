hIPNAT (**h**IPNAT: **I**mage **P**rocessing for **N**euro**A**natomy and
**T**ree-like structures) was a prototyping project aimed at providing ImageJ-based tools for the analysis  of neurons and related structures. It was also the driving force behind the [re-write of Simple_Neurite_Tracer](https://github.com/morphonets/SNT), and the first project to be distributed through the [Neuroanatomy update site](https://imagej.net/Neuroanatomy).

The plugins and scripts deemed obsolete have been [archived](https://github.com/tferr/hIPNAT/releases/tag/1.0.12-SNAPSHOT). The modern counterparts can be found in Fiji's Script Editor (look under the _Templates>Neuroanatomy>_ menu) and are provided by [SNT](https://imagej.net/SNT:_Scripting). Other plugins in this project can be accessed through _Plugins>Neuroanatomy>Neuroanatomy Shortcut Window_.
